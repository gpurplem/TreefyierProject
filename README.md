# Treefyier

## About the project

The software takes 10 or less integer values in the range of 0-99
and generates the position of each value as a node in a binary
search tree following the pre-order algorithm.

## Instructions

- Values should be input as arguments to program call from console.
- Maximum level is four (starting from zero). It's a five-node-high tree.
- First value input is the root node.
- Algorithm for deleting a node: tree is rebuilt as if removed value had never been input.


## How nodes are identified

The number that identifies each node is based on the level it is.
It starts on level one with number 1, then moves down each level
incrementing from left to right.
